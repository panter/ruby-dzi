= Ruby Dzi Generator

A forked project of Deep Zoom Slicer

Ruby Dzi slices images into several tiles and creates dzi descriptor file.
Sliced images are compatible for use with OpenZoom, Deep Zoom and Seadragon.

This implementation uses plain command line image magick which makes it more
stable, easier to debug and faster (imho).
